# Contributing

If you would like to add a feature to Catlas, you are awesome! Please fork the repo, make the changes you would like to your forked repo and open a PR. You can request Brook or Kirby as a reviewer.

## Coding Guidelines
1. Develop using the available docker environment so things are consistent with the repo.
2. Ensure your changes follow [black](https://github.com/psf/black) code format. We have a test for this but still good to do upfront.
3. Try to use [google style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), so people can easily interpret your awesome work.
4. We don't have any other strict requirements but try to do you best to make your code intuitive by choosing good variable/function/class/file names, use comments where things are opaque, write things modularly when possible etc.
